# 🧠 LockIn: Study Tracker

![LockIn Logo](public/LockInLogo.png)

**LockIn** is a Chrome extension designed to help you stay focused while studying.  
It uses **eye-tracking** and **time tracking** to measure how long you stay focused and rewards you with points and score multipliers for maintaining concentration.  
When you look away or lose focus, your streak (and multiplier) drops — motivating you to “lock in” and stay on task!

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. When you start a session, LockIn begins tracking your time and focus.  
2. Every second, your **score increases** based on your multiplier.  
3. Your **multiplier grows** the longer you stay focused:
   - 0–9 min → 1×  
   - 10–19 min → 1.5×  
   - 20–29 min → 2×  
   - 30–39 min → 2.5×  
   - 40+ min → 3×  
4. If you look away from your screen for too long, your multiplier resets.  
5. When you press **“Session Complete”**, your stats are saved, and the timer stops.
